=Available versions of Sailcut8=

This page describes the versions of Sailcut8 available for download.

1. *sailcut8-packageV1.0.zip*

This is the original version of Sailcut8 from Robert Laine.  

Download this .zip archive file and unzip it into a folder on your computer.  Run the setup.exe to install Sailcut8.  You need to install this version before any of the other version lsited below.

2. *sailcut8ss.exe*

This is an 'under development' version of Sailcut8 that has been donated by Steve Studley.  This version adds more languages, a choice of measurement units, a re-arranged user interface, and a choice between Van Loan and Hasler-McLeod style sail plans.

If you want to try this version then you must first install the original sailcut8 package (item 1. above) and then download this file (sailcut8ss.exe) into the the same directory that you used for sailcut8.  This is probably C:\Program Files\Sailcut8.

Double click the sailcut8ss.exe file to start this version of sailcut8.  You may want to create your own shortcut to this file for future use.
