The cab file for your application has been built as 'C:\VB6packs\sailcut8\sailcut8.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (C:\VB6packs\sailcut8\Support\sailcut8.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.

Edited to test svn notifications - please ignore.
